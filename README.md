# Movie-Data-Analysis
Our project's main goal is to use Python to explore a big dataset from The Movie Database (TMDB). We want to find answers to important questions about what makes movies do well at the box office and get good reviews. They want to know what kinds of movies are like valuable treasure, what types of movies people enjoy watching.
